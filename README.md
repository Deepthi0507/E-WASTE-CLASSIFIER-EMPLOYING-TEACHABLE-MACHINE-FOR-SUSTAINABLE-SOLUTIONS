# E-WASTE-CLASSIFIER-EMPLOYING-TEACHABLE-MACHINE-FOR-SUSTAINABLE-SOLUTIONS
The E-Waste Classifier uses Teachable Machine to categorize electronic waste for efficient recycling, promoting sustainability and environmental responsibility.
### Project Overview

This project presents an innovative e-waste analytics solution combining Teachable Machine and Streamlit to encourage responsible electronic device disposal. Users can input their old device model into an intuitive Streamlit interface, which estimates the recoverable precious metals based on the device's classification. Teachable Machine’s machine learning models help identify the devices and calculate the metal content, promoting sustainable practices. The application rewards users with credit points for proper disposal, fostering environmental responsibility and engagement in recycling programs. This project aims to integrate advanced technology and incentivize participation in e-waste management, contributing to a circular economy.

### Teachable Machine

Teachable Machine is a web-based tool developed by Google's Creative Lab that allows users to train machine learning models without needing to write any code. It's designed to make machine learning accessible to everyone, regardless of their programming experience. The tool uses a technique called transfer learning, which leverages pre-trained models and allows users to retrain them with their own data. With Teachable Machine, you can train models to recognize images, sounds, or even pose detection using your webcam.

### Streamlit

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that allows you to create interactive web applications for data science and machine learning projects with ease. It simplifies the process of building and sharing web apps directly from Python scripts, without requiring knowledge of web development languages such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.


### Objectives

•	Develop a user-friendly interface using Streamlit to facilitate input of old device models.
•	Train machine learning models with Teachable Machine to classify device models and estimate precious metal content.
•	Implement a credit points system based on the estimated precious metal recovery.
•	Integrate the Teachable Machine models and credit points system into the Streamlit application.
•	Test the application for accuracy, usability, and functionality.
•	Deploy the application for public use and monitor user engagement and feedback.

### Dataset

The dataset for this project likely consists of images of various electronic devices and equipment, such as batteries, televisions, printers, mobile phones, mice, keyboards, PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards), microwaves, players, and washing machines. Each image in the dataset is labeled with the corresponding class or category of the electronic device it represents.
